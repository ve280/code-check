    // spades from 2-A, then the hearts, then the clubs, then the
    // diamonds.  The first card dealt should be the 2 of Spades.

    void reset();
    // EFFECTS: resets the deck to the state of a "newly opened" deck
    // of cards:

    void shuffle(int n);
    // REQUIRES: n is between 0 and 52, inclusive.

    // MODIFIES: this

    // EFFECTS: cut the deck into two segments: the first n cards,
    // called the "left", and the rest called the "right".  Note that
    // either right or left might be empty.  Then, rearrange the deck
    // to be the first card of the right, then the first card of the
    // left, the 2nd of right, the 2nd of left, and so on.  Once one
    // side is exhausted, fill in the remainder of the deck with the
    // cards remaining in the other side.  Finally, make the first
    // card in this shuffled deck the next card to deal.  For example,
    // shuffle(26) on a newly-reset() deck results in: 2-clubs,
    // 2-spades, 3-clubs, 3-spades ... A-diamonds, A-hearts.
    //
    // Note: if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some
    // cards dealt, those cards should first be restored to the deck
    // in the order in which they were dealt, preserving the most
    // recent post-shuffled/post-reset state. After shuffling, the
    // next card to deal is the first one in the deck.

    Card deal();
    // MODIFIES: this

    // EFFECTS: returns the next card to be dealt.  If no cards
    // remain, throws an instance of DeckEmpty.

    int cardsLeft();
    // EFFECTS: returns the number of cards in the deck that have not
    // been dealt since the last reset/shuffle.
